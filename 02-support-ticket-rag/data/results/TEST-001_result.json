  "response": "Dear Customer,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding your declined payment. I understand this is frustrating, especially when you have sufficient funds available.\n\nBased on our knowledge base, a credit card can be declined for several reasons beyond just insufficient funds. These include:\n*   An **expired card**.\n*   **Incorrect card details** being entered (such as card number, expiration date, or CVV).\n*   Your **bank's fraud prevention** system flagging the transaction.\n\nTo help resolve this, please try the following steps:\n1.  **Verify your card details** to ensure they are all correctly entered.\n2.  If the issue persists, please **contact your bank directly**. They can provide specific information on why the transaction was declined and help clear any potential fraud flags.\n3.  You may also try using a **different payment method** if available.\n\nWe hope this helps get your payment processed successfully.",
